    <h2>Physics Notes</h2>
    <div class="note-title">Class 8: Motion and Measurement of Distances</div>
    <div class="note-content">
      Motion is the change in position of an object with respect to time. Distance is measured using a meter scale or measuring tape. Standard units of measurement include meter (m), centimeter (cm), and kilometer (km). Speed is the distance covered per unit time.
    </div>

    <div class="note-title">Class 9: Force and Laws of Motion</div>
    <div class="note-content">
      A force is a push or pull that can change the motion of an object. Newton's first law states that an object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by an external force. Newton's second law relates force, mass, and acceleration as F = ma. Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
    </div>

    <div class="note-title">Class 10: Light â€“ Reflection and Refraction</div>
    <div class="note-content">
      Light travels in a straight line and changes direction when it hits a surface (reflection) or passes through different media (refraction). The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Refraction causes apparent bending of objects submerged in water.
    </div>

  <section id="chemistry">
    <h2>Chemistry Notes</h2>
    <div class="note-title">Class 8: Physical and Chemical Changes</div>
    <div class="note-content">
      Physical changes do not form new substances; examples include melting, freezing, and dissolving. Chemical changes result in new substances with different properties, such as rusting of iron or burning paper.
    </div>

    <div class="note-title">Class 9: The Fundamental Unit of Life</div>
    <div class="note-content">
      The cell is the basic unit of life. Cells have a membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. Cell division is essential for growth and repair. Unicellular organisms consist of a single cell, while multicellular organisms have many cells.
    </div>

    <div class="note-title">Class 10: Chemical Reactions and Equations</div>
    <div class="note-content">
      A chemical reaction involves reactants transforming into products. Equations represent these reactions using symbols and formulas. Balancing chemical equations ensures mass is conserved on both sides.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="biology">
    <h2>Biology Notes</h2>
    <div class="note-title">Class 8: Crop Production and Management</div>
    <div class="note-content">
      Crop production includes preparing soil, sowing seeds, watering, and harvesting. Crop management involves practices like weed control, fertilizer use, and protection from pests and diseases.
    </div>

    <div class="note-title">Class 9: The Structure and Functions of Cells</div>
    <div class="note-content">
      Cells contain organelles like mitochondria (energy producer), chloroplasts (photosynthesis), and nucleus (control center). Cell membranes regulate transport; cytoplasm is the site of chemical reactions.
    </div>

    <div class="note-title">Class 10: Life Processes</div>
    <div class="note-content">
      Life processes include nutrition, respiration, transportation, and excretion. These processes maintain homeostasis and support growth and reproduction.
